Project Overview:
Our group propose to develop a guitar chorus effector, which enables user to enhance their guitar sounds with chorus effects, 
providing control over parameters such as mix, delay time, and number of voices via Belaâ€™s physical electronic components control (mix and delay time using knobs, and number of voices using a button). 
The effector reads analog signals from the electric guitar and converts the mixed analog signals to digital signals. 
This project aims to create a user-friendly and customizable tool for musicians to add depth to their guitar tones.
